# Django REST Image Upload Example
This Django tutorial app was created for the purpose of demonstrating Django and Django Rest Framework. It shows the basics
of writing a REST endpoint which allows uploading and retrieving pictures.

I also wrote a [tutorial](tutorial/README.md), though if you just want to try my code out, I suggest using using the Quick Start 
or the Docker Image below (todo).

Be aware that there are multiple branches, one for each chapter of the tutorial.

There is also a YouTube series about this tutorial:
