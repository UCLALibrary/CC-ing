The image capturing process will be completed in 3 phases:
1) Initial Image Capture via  DSLR/GoPro/Phone camera 
2) Transfer of Image to a server/computer for file naming & sorting
3) Feeding of files to Django web server for language sorting & categorization (final step before being passed to Tesseract-Scribe-Workflow)
The full process is described via the following Google Slides by Calvin Ha: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RhPzRCBMn6VyBv0Hj1DoxcpD3o8EA8QBqeb4y_QMB9U/edit#slide=id.p
