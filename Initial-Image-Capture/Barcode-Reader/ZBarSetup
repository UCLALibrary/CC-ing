For Barcode Reading, we choose to use ZBar Bar Code Reader (the Python integrated version).
ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code. These are the Python bindings for the library. 
Check the website for latest info: http://zbar.sourceforge.net/

IMPORTANT: ZBar from the above site is only compatible with Python 2. Python 3 will fail to run ZBar from the site. As a result, we need to use the following ZBAR Wrapper for Python 3 written by @BrettAtoms which can be found at the following site: https://github.com/brettatoms/zbar-ctypes.git. However, please note that I have already set up all files in this GitHub Repo, with a few changes to the original code, so please use this code for UCLA/CC-ING purposes!

Note: As a Windows user, I recommend using the above GitHub site for setup of ZBar, as it is the most straight-forward method that I found. If someone finds another means to install ZBar, please do notify me!
