For basic instructions and outline, refer to: https://github.com/zooniverse/scribeAPI/wiki/Setup-Mac-OSX

When on instruction #3, you may run into an error that looks something like this.

	Requirements installation failed with status: 12.

If so, the command "brew upgrade" should do the trick. The output is as follows:

Now, when you run "rvm install ruby" it should work:
NOTE: the command "rvm install ruby" is essentially the same as "rvm install 2.1.5", as the latter
is simply installing a specific version of ruby. As of 2/1/2017 we run "rvm install 2.1.5", despite
2.1.5 not being the latest version, because we want to have everybody running the same version when
we are developing the CC-ing project.

I personally ran the command "rvm docs generate-ri" in case I needed documentation down the road.

With ruby installed you can set the default ruby version.

	rvm use 2.1.5 --default


Once you run the instructions in step 4 and the final command "mongod" starts to wait for connections
then you can open a new tab in terminal to continue the rest of the guide. 

	2017-02-02T00:40:49.714-0800 I NETWORK  [thread1] waiting for connections on port 27017


The next problem I ran into was with step 7. "npm install" kept on throwing errors when it got to the
"node-gyp rebuild" step. I was able to fixed the problem by following the instructions at the error
message at the end of the output. 

Go to nodejs homepage and download the latest node.js software with their installer.

	https://nodejs.org/en/download/

A part of the error that resulted from "npm install" looked like this:

	npm WARN scribeAPI@ No repository field.

	npm ERR! Please include the following file with any support request:
	npm ERR!     /Users/jeffreyqiu/Desktop/BuildUCLA/CC-ing/scribeAPI/npm-debug.log

Now that the latest versions of node.js and npm had been installed the "npm install" command
worked fine except for a few warnings of deprecated declarations.

	npm WARN deprecated graceful-fs@2.0.3: graceful-fs v3.0.0 and before will fail on node releases >= v7.0. Please update to graceful-fs@^4.0.0 as soon as possible. Use 'npm ls graceful-fs' to find it in the tree.

So, with everything nearly in place we can launch the scribe application on localport http://0.0.0.0:3000

Make sure that mongod is still running in another tab. Then in another tab you will run the command 

	rake project:load['PROJECT_KEY']

Then, in yet another tab, run the command 

	rails s


Note: If you do run mongod and you suspended it, but the process is still running in the background, then
use the command "ps" and "kill" to get rid of that mongod process.

Once you have all three instances of mongod, rake, and rails, running then you go to the url http://0.0.0.0:3000
on a browser of your choice to see that scribe is launched and running.
