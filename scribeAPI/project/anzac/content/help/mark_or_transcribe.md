You can select from two interfaces: “Mark” and “Transcribe.” In “Mark,” you’ll be identifying different types of documents, and interesting and relevant portions of the documents. In “Transcribe,” you’ll be typing out what those relevant portions say. You can also simultaneously mark and transcribe by using the “Mark” interface; this is best if you want to go through documents in order.
