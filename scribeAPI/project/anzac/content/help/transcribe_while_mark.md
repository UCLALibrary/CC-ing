There are two ways to transcribe while you are marking. The first is to use the buttons that appear to the bottom right of each rectangular mark. This will open a window to allow you to transcribe just that mark. The second is to click “Transcribe This Page” once you have finished marking it. This will take you to the “Transcribe” interface just for that one page, and return you to “Mark” when you are done.
