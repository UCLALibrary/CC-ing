In “Transcribe,” you will be presented with portions of documents that other people have already marked, and you will simply type out what you see and click . If the highlighted portion does not contain the information requested (for instance, a birthplace that has been marked as a date), please select “Bad Mark.” If it is unreadable, select “Illegible.”
