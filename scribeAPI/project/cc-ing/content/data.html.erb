## Data exports

With help from volunteers like yourself, we are extracting metadata from foreign language books so we can catalog them into the UCLA Libray's database. Providing the UCLA Library with a larger variety of books in different languages will be of great use to undergraduate and graduate researchers, professors, and cultural organizations that wish to learn more about a specific culture.
