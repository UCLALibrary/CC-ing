## A Brief Introduction to CC'ing

### Our Goal

To crowdsource the translation of important information (author, title, etc.) of foreign language books. There are thousands of such books that need to be catalogued into the UCLA library's system. We need the assistance of the greater UCLA community and anyone else willing to lend a hand!

To divide the tasks -- and to help ensure accuracy -- we've broken the work into 3 free-standing tasks. These tasks follow a sequence, but they can be performed independently (feel free to focus on the one you enjoy best).

### Task 1: Mark

Here you'll be identifying various pieces of information on the page. You won't be typing, just drawing boxes. This helps plot a route for the transcribers in Task 2. You may see existing marks left by other users. Just pick up where they left off. Most of the time, these marks will be generated by input given from OCR technology.

### Task 2: Transcribe

Here you'll translate the content in each box marked by others. If you are not completely confident, don't worry! We'll get these translated multiple times to ensure accuracy, so give it your best shot and move on.

### Task 3: Verify

Every document will be transcribed and translated several times by multiple volunteers, and our software looks for agreement among them. If a field has been transcribed consistently and independently three times, it has reached "consensus" and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up in the Verify task, where you can vote on the most accurate transcription, or, if needed, add your own.

### Ready?

You may find you prefer one task over another, so try them all! All tasks are essential steps in the greater effort to serve the UCLA community by providing it access to more books in its libraries!
