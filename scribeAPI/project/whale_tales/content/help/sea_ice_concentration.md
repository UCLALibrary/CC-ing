**Ice fields** are sheets of ice too large to know how big they are.

**Floes** are large pieces of sea ice tens to hundreds of yards across.

**Drift ice** is a mix of large and small pieces of sea ice.

**Pack ice** is a large expanse of drift ice. ('Open pack' is when pieces of ice are close but not jammed together; 'close pack' is when pieces are in contact.)

**Sailing ice** is so spread out that a sailing ship can navigate with ease.

Select any and all of these that you see anywhere on the page. You do not need to draw any rectangles for this step. If you find another word, please add it to the sea-ice glossary.
