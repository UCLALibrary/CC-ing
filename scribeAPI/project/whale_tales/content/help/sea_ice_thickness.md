**Bay ice** is newly formed sea-ice, from near 0- to 1-foot thick. There are two forms: large, smooth sheets of thin ice, usually grey or grey-white in color; and 'pancake-ice,' circular pieces of ice of a few inches to several feet across. This may also be called 'young' or 'new' ice.

**Sludge**, also called 'oatmeal' or 'porridge' ice, is formed when the sea is agitated when freezing.

**Brash** is a patch of ice made of fragments of older ice, or flinty pieces of icebergs (glacier ice).

**Light ice** is from 1 to 3 feet in thickness.

**Heavy ice** is from 3 feet and upwards.

**Hummocks** are formed when pressure forces pieces of ice to pile up, and can be many feet thick.

Select any and all of these that you see anywhere on the page. You do not need to draw any rectangles for this step. If you find another word, please add it to the sea-ice glossary.
